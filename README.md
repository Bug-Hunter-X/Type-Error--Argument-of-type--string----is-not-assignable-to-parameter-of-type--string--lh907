# Type Error in TypeScript
This example demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript that occurs when passing an array to a function expecting a string argument. The `greeter` function expects a single string, but the `user` variable is an array of strings.  This results in a compile-time error.

The solution shows how to correctly handle this scenario, either by modifying the function signature or by accessing the individual elements of the array.
